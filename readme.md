# Uploader is a simple Tool for uploading files on a webserver

it uses [Plupload](http://www.plupload.com/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/). 

## Features:
- Multiple File selection
- Progress indicator (per file & total)
- File type filter

If you want some sort of authentication (you should), you can use .htaccess on Apache.
